  "description": "Back when I played the game only the Java applet existed, and there was no such thing as a HTML5 version. So, in the past few days I've been analyzing CSM code (front-end) to understand how the game is rendered and what kind of information I can get from the API. This post will cover some of these aspects, being more suited to developers, it still has some interesting information about the maps itself.",
